Project Overview

We have consulted with our Industry Advisory Board and a major component
for job consideration is that a student should be able to show a list of projects they have completed, along with easy to access information about your work history and current Github activity.Your portfolio is one link that can be provided to future employers to showcase your skills and present easily accessible information about you.

Objectives:

    Use Bootstrap to build a responsive application.
Use modern front end development tools.
Create one central domain
for organizing projects, biographical information, and employer contact info.
